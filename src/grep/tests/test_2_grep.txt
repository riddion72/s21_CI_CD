Do not use outdated and legacy language constructions and library functions. Pay attention to the legacy and obsolete marks in the official documentation on the language and the libraries used. Use the POSIX.1-2017 standard.
When writing code it is necessary to follow the Google style
The programs must be executable files with command line arguments
The programs must be built with Makefile with appropriate targets: s21_cat, s21_grep
If third-party libraries are used, there must be build scripts in makefile to connect/load them
Integration tests must cover all flag variants and input values, based on a comparison with the behavior of real Bash utilities
The programs must be developed according to the principles of structured programming
Code duplication must be avoided, common modules must be reused between the utilities. Common modules can be moved to a separate folder src/common
You can use standard and non-standard C libraries, or you can use your own developed libraries from other projects
The statement of the message in the case of an error does not matter
